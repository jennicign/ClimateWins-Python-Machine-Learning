Each part addresses specific objectives, key questions, and utilizes different data sources. This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in understanding climate change impacts and health outcomes.

## Achievment 1: Feasibility Study on Using Machine Learning for Client Needs

### Objective

To evaluate the viability of using machine learning models to meet the client's needs, focusing on predicting climate change consequences and analyzing hospital readmissions.

### Requirements

- Can machine learning models provide accurate and actionable predictions for climate change impacts?
- What are the most suitable machine learning techniques for analyzing weather data and hospital readmissions?
- How can the organization integrate these models into their workflow to benefit from predictive insights?

### Data Sources

1. **Weather Data**: Collected from various weather stations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation measurements.
2. **Pleasant Day Indicators**: Data indicating whether a day was considered pleasant, collected in a consistent manner with the weather measurement data.

### Approach

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution, missing values, and key features.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating different machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Decision Trees.
- **Model Training and Validation**: Training models on historical data and validating their performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Integration and Recommendations**: Providing insights on how these models can be integrated into the client's existing systems.

## Achievment 2: Thought Experiment on Predicting Future Weather Data using Machine Learning

### Objective

To conduct a thought experiment on the use of machine learning to analyze weather data and predict wheather.

### Requirements

- Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
- Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
- Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.
- Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
- Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years

### Data Sources

1. **Weather Measurement Data**: Historical weather data collected from various weather stations.
2. **Pleasant Day Indicators**: Data indicating whether a day was considered pleasant, collected in a consistent manner with the weather measurement data.

### Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important weather variables that influence the pleasantness of a day.
- **Model Training**: Using Random Forest models and other machine learning techniques to predict the pleasantness of a day.
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Developing hypotheses on how different weather variables impact daily pleasantness and testing these hypotheses using the trained models.
- **Practical Objectives**: Formulating practical objectives for using these predictions in various applications, such as event planning, tourism, and public health advisories.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in analyzing complex datasets to derive meaningful insights. By addressing specific objectives and key questions, it showcases the feasibility and practical applications of these techniques in predicting climate change impacts.
